Task 2 - Data Cleaning And Exploratory Data analysis
📌 Objective

To perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset in order to understand the data, identify patterns, and analyze factors affecting passenger survival.

📂 Dataset

Dataset: Titanic Dataset

Source: Kaggle

Contains passenger details such as age, gender, class, fare, and survival status.

🧹 Data Cleaning

The following steps were performed:

Handled missing values in Age and Embarked

Removed columns with excessive missing data (Cabin)

Converted categorical variables into numerical form

Removed unnecessary columns for analysis

Checked for duplicates and outliers

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to explore relationships between variables.

Analysis Performed:

Survival rate by gender

Survival rate by passenger class

Age distribution of passengers

Fare vs survival comparison

Visualizations:

Bar plots

Histograms

Box plots

Count plots
